## Sommlid (he/him)
  
Hi! I am Sommlid. By day I am an engineering student in the city of Boston, Massachusetts. In my free time my hobbies include listening to electronic music, data hoarding, bicycling, and generally learning new skills, hence the creation of this website. Welcome to my personal homepage; I hope you enjoy your stay!
