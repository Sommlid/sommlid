## Sommlid (he/him)
  
Hi, thanks for visiting! I am an electronic music enthusiast from Manhattan, New York. This site is my creative outlet.

Contents of blog posts will include some or all of the following:
- Opinions about music from a non-technical listener's perspective
- Discussion about archivism and hoarding of digital music
- Commentary on the electronic music scene at large
- Other topics I haven't decided on yet :)

You can find a more comprehensive bio [here](https://sommlid.rocks/about/).
